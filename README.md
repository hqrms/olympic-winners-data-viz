# Olympics JSON Visualization  


## Introduction 

This repository contains the python codes used to generate the visualization of the sample data, displayed on [ag-grid]. The libraries used in this project are referenced on the dependencies topic and the language is Python.

To run and see the visualizations you can use the Jupyter Notebook or run the python code locally

## Why Plotly?

Plotly is open source, quite simple to use and support interactive graphics. The basic plots and components of Plotly are perfect to show the requested JSON data and can be configured to work with filters and other interactions.

##  Jupyter 

Jupyter was used to test some plots and interactions with them. It can be accessed on this link. You can run the code and see the plots and some of the code used on the other version of it.

> Packages 
> - pycountry
> - plotly
> - dash
> - requests

All of them can be installed using the command:
> pip install (library)

## How to run

After trying to run the code please check the dependencies topic and follow the instruction to install them.
